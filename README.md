Based on the amazing [Chatpad](https://github.com/deiucanta/chatpad), Chatpad-Plus takes it one step further and adds functionalities such as:
- Improved consistency on the personality of the AI responses
- Improved markdown support with code highlighting depending on the code language
- 'Stop' button for stopping the request if the reply is not relevant
- 'Regenerate response' button for generating a different response for the last reply
- New 'bro talk' mode, for the lulz :D
